Code to go with Karjus et al., "Two problems and solutions in  evolutionary corpus-based language dynamics research",  presented at SLE 2018 in Tallinn (the semantic change bias part). See here for the code to run the topical-cultural advection model (the first half of the talk) - https://github.com/andreskarjus/topical_cultural_advection_model

Slides (with interactive plots you can play with) available here: https://andreskarjus.github.io/sle_tallinn_languagedynamics

The results.RData file contains precomputed results. See the script (.R file) for more details.

The `coha2000.RData` file constains preparsed (cleaned, tokenized, filtered) sample data to replicate the analsys (load into R using `load()` - it contains one object, called `perioddata`, which is a character vector where each element is a word).
